# IT-359 Group Project — Automated Recon Output Parsing & Alerting (Educational)

## 📌 Project Purpose (The What)
This project demonstrates how basic networking tools (e.g., nmap, netcat, masscan) can be combined with simple scripts to **parse saved scan outputs**, normalize them into readable data, and **alert** when an **unexpected open port** appears. It is designed for **authorized, lab-only** use and focuses on **post-scan automation** and reporting.

> ⚠️ **Legal/Ethical**: Only scan networks you own or have **explicit written authorization** for. The default workflow is **parsing-only** and **dry-run**.

## ⚙️ Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- See `requirements.txt` for Python libs

---

## 🧰 Setup (macOS)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ammitc7/IT-359-Group-Project.git
cd IT-359-Group-Project
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Usage (Quick Demo)
In Step 2 we will add the safe demo command that parses a sample nmap XML and writes a report (no live scanning).
Activate your virtual environment:
source .venv/bin/activate
Run the orchestrator (coming in Step 2).
View outputs in the output/ folder.
🧪 Testing
pytest -q
