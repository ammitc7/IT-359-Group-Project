1) Only perform scans on systems you own or where you have **explicit written authorization**.
2) For any executed scan, keep an `auth.txt` file (not committed) containing the approval reference.
3) This project defaults to **parsing saved outputs** and will include a **dry-run** wrapper for any optional live scans.
4) Maintain an audit log: operator, date/time, target, purpose, authorization reference.
